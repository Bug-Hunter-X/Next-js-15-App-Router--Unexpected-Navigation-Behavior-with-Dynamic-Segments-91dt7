# Next.js 15 App Router Bug: Unexpected Navigation Behavior with Dynamic Segments

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's app router when navigating between pages with dynamic segments.  The issue manifests as unexpected behavior, such as blank pages or incorrect data display after navigation.

## Bug Description

The application intermittently fails to render correctly after navigating to a page that utilizes dynamic segments in its route. This erratic behavior makes the user experience unreliable.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate between the home page and the about page. Observe the unpredictable behavior of rendering.

## Expected Behavior

Smooth and consistent page transitions without any rendering errors or inconsistencies.  The about page should render consistently and accurately.

## Actual Behavior

The about page occasionally renders blank, displays incomplete data, or otherwise renders incorrectly. This erratic behavior is not predictable.

## Solution

The solution involves a combination of approaches to ensure consistent rendering. This often includes double-checking the use of dynamic segments in the route configuration, handling async data fetching within the page component, and verifying that the navigation is handled appropriately by the app router.  See `bugSolution.js` for a possible fix.  This often involves using `useSearchParams` hook to fetch the data and display correctly.
